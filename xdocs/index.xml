      <p>
      joeq is a Java 2 (JDK 1.3/1.4/1.5) compatible virtual machine.
      joeq is unique in that it is entirely implemented in Java<sup>TM</sup>,
      leading to greater reliability, portability, maintainability, and efficiency.
      It is also language-independent, so code from any supported language can be
      seamlessly compiled, linked, and executed --- all dynamically!
      </p>
      <p>
      joeq began in early January 2001 by John Whaley, a Ph.D. student at Stanford University.
      The first release was made on February 1, 2001 under the Library GNU Public License.

      joeq (pronounced "jyo-kyu-" like the name "Joe" and the letter "Q") means
      advanced level in Japanese
